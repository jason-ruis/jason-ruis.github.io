                    The Reformed tradition has always maintained that Scripture is our ultimate authority, mediated through carefully crafted confessions that summarize biblical teaching. Yet today, many Reformed churches are experiencing a crisis of confessional authority—not because our confessions have failed, but because we have failed to understand their proper role and application.

                <div class="article-body">
                    <p>
                        Walk into most Reformed denominational assemblies today, and you'll witness a puzzling phenomenon. Churches that claim to subscribe to historic confessions—the Westminster Standards, the Three Forms of Unity, the 1689 Baptist Confession—regularly make decisions that seem to contradict or minimize those very standards. How did we get here? And more importantly, how do we recover proper confessional authority without falling into rigid scholasticism on one side or theological drift on the other?
                    </p>

                    <h2>Understanding Confessional Authority</h2>

                    <p>
                        First, we must clarify what we mean by "confessional authority." Reformed confessions are not inspired Scripture. They do not carry divine authority in themselves. Rather, they possess a derived authority—they are authoritative insofar as they accurately represent biblical teaching.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is why Reformed churches historically required subscription to confessions "as containing the system of doctrine taught in Scripture" or similar language. The confession's authority rests entirely on its biblical accuracy. If we could demonstrate that a confessional statement contradicts Scripture, we would be obligated to reject that statement, not Scripture.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "The confession serves the church by preserving biblical truth across generations, guarding against theological innovation, and providing a common doctrinal foundation for ministry and mission."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        But here's the critical point: when churches adopt confessions through proper ecclesiastical process, those confessions function as authoritative standards for that church's teaching and practice. They're not mere historical documents or optional theological preferences. They define what the church believes and teaches.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Current Crisis</h2>

                    <p>
                        So where has this broken down? I see several troubling patterns in contemporary Reformed churches:
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Treating Confessions as Historical Curiosities</h3>

                    <p>
                        Some treat our confessions as interesting historical documents that reflect how people thought about theology "back then," but not as binding standards for today. This approach empties confessional subscription of meaning. If the confession only tells us what 17th-century theologians believed, why bother subscribing to it at all?
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. The "Good Faith" Exception</h3>

                    <p>
                        Others maintain that as long as someone subscribes "in good faith" to the confession, the specific content matters less than the sincerity of the subscription. But this reduces confessional integrity to a subjective feeling rather than objective doctrinal agreement.
                    </p>

                    <div class="pullquote">
                        "Confessional subscription without confessional accountability is meaningless. If we're not willing to address clear departures from our stated standards, why maintain those standards at all?"
                    </div>

                    <h3>3. Perpetual Reinterpretation</h3>

                    <p>
                        A third pattern involves constantly reinterpreting confessional language to accommodate positions the confession was written to exclude. While we must apply confessional principles to new situations, there's a difference between faithful application and theological gymnastics designed to make the confession say something its authors never intended.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Path Forward: Confessional Renewal</h2>

                    <p>
                        How do we recover proper confessional authority? Here are several crucial steps:
                    </p>

                    <h3>Honest Subscription</h3>

                    <p>
                        We need to recover honest, meaningful subscription to our confessions. If someone cannot in good conscience affirm a confessional position, integrity demands they either:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Study further to understand why the church has historically held this position</li>
                        <li>File formal exceptions through proper ecclesiastical channels</li>
                        <li>Recognize that they may not be suited for office in a church requiring that confession</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        What we cannot do is subscribe to a confession while privately disagreeing with substantial portions of it. That's not confessional subscription; it's confessional dishonesty.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Confessional Accountability</h3>

                    <p>
                        Churches must be willing to exercise confessional discipline. When officebearers teach positions that clearly contradict the church's confessional standards, church assemblies have a responsibility to address this—not necessarily by immediate deposition, but through a process of instruction, discussion, and if necessary, discipline.
                    </p>

                    <div class="scripture-reference">
                        "Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine..." - 2 Timothy 4:2-3
                    </div>

                    <h3>Proper Confessional Revision</h3>

                    <p>
                        If a church believes its confession needs updating or modification, proper channels exist for that. Major Reformed denominations have processes for confessional revision. These are appropriately difficult—changing a church's doctrinal standards should require broad consensus and careful deliberation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But attempting to change a confession's meaning through reinterpretation rather than formal revision circumvents the church's authority and undermines confessional integrity.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Teaching Our Confessions</h3>

                    <p>
                        Many church members—and even some officebearers—have never carefully studied their church's confession. How can we maintain confessional authority if we don't know what our confession says or why it matters?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Churches need to recover robust catechetical and confessional instruction. Our people should understand not just individual doctrines, but how those doctrines fit together in the system of truth our confessions present.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Conclusion: The Stakes Are High</h2>

                    <p>
                        This is not an academic debate about 17th-century documents. Confessional integrity affects everything: the gospel we preach, the church we build, the disciples we make, the next generation we teach.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When churches abandon confessional accountability, doctrinal drift inevitably follows. Within a generation or two, churches that once stood firmly on Reformed orthodoxy find themselves embracing positions their confessions were written to reject.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The solution isn't rigid scholasticism that treats every jot and tittle of our confessions as equally important. Nor is it a fuzzy "mere Christianity" that reduces Christian truth to the lowest common denominator.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Rather, we need principled confessionalism: holding firmly to our confessional standards while recognizing their derivative authority, maintaining accountability while exercising pastoral wisdom, preserving historic Reformed orthodoxy while faithfully applying it to contemporary challenges.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The trumpet must sound a clear note. The church is watching. More importantly, the Lord of the church is watching. May we prove faithful stewards of the theological heritage we've received, preserving it intact for the generations to follow.
                    </p>
