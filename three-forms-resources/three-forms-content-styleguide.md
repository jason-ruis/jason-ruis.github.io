_Exploring the Riches of the Reformed Confessions_

### 🕮 1. Voice & Tone

**Voice:**

- Scholarly yet warm — reverent toward Scripture and the confessions.
    
- Clear and concise — avoid fluff or self-promotion.
    
- Faithful to the Reformed tradition — use historically and theologically careful language.
    

**Tone:**

- Humble and invitational, not elitist.
    
- Pastoral, accessible, and rooted in Scripture.
    
- Aim to _serve_ the church, not just inform.

|**Tags**|3–6 keywords for search and filtering|_#catechism, #studyguide, #reformedtheology, #hebrews_|

---

### 🎯 3. Writing Guidelines

**✅ Do:**

- Be specific about what makes the resource useful (“comprehensive guide for youth catechesis”).
    
- Include historical or theological distinctives when appropriate.
    
- Maintain consistency in capitalization and punctuation.
    
- When quoting, use em dashes (—) for clarity and visual polish.
    

**🚫 Don’t:**

- Use subjective praise (“This is amazing!”).
    
- Include personal opinions about doctrine or authors.
    
- Use overly academic jargon without context.

### 🧭 4. Categorization Standards

Each resource should belong to:

1. **One primary Confession category:**
    
    - _Heidelberg Catechism_
        
    - _Belgic Confession_
        
    - _Canons of Dort_
        
    - _Combined / Comparative_
        
2. **One or more Resource Types:**
    
    - Book
        
    - Study Guide
        
    - Curriculum
        
    - Devotional
        
    - Sermon / Lecture Series
        
    - Article / Essay
        
    - Podcast / Audio
        
    - Video / Documentary
        
    - Commentary
        
3. **Optional Tags:**  
    These improve search and filtering. Examples:
    
    - _Reformed Theology_
        
    - _Catechesis_
        
    - _Church Education_
        
    - _Confessional Study_

### 💡 5. Formatting Conventions

|Element|Convention|
|---|---|
|Titles|Title Case (_The Canons of Dort Explained_)|
|Author Names|Full name if available (_John Calvin_ not _J. Calvin_)|
|Quotations|Use double quotes (“ ”), italics for book titles|
|Scripture|Use ESV citation format (e.g., _Romans 8:29–30_)|
|Numbers|Spell out one–ten; use numerals beyond that|
|URLs|Always use `https://`; avoid tracking parameters when possible|
|Dates|Full year only (_Published 2021_)|

> Design each resource card with a cream background (#F7F4EE), deep navy headings (#1C2A3A), and brass-gold accent text (#C49A47). Use Lora for headings and Inter for body text. Include rounded corners, generous spacing, and a clear typographic hierarchy. Add a small brass emblem of three interlocking circles in the corner for branding consistency.
