                <h2>What are the Canons of Dort?</h2>
                <p>The <strong>Canons of Dort</strong> (also known as the <em>Canons of Dordt</em> or <em>Synod of Dort</em>) are one of the Three Forms of Unity, the confessional standards of Reformed churches. Adopted at the international Synod of Dort in 1618-1619, they represent the Reformed Church's response to the theological challenges posed by Arminianism.</p>

                <p>These canons are unique among Reformed confessions because they systematically address five specific doctrinal points that were disputed in the early 17th century. Today, they are best known as the basis for the "Five Points of Calvinism," often remembered by the acronym <strong>TULIP</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Historical Background: The Synod of Dort (1618-1619)</h3>
                <p>In the early 1600s, the Dutch Reformed Church faced a theological crisis. <strong>Jacob Arminius</strong> (1560-1609), a professor at Leiden University, had challenged traditional Reformed teaching on predestination and divine grace. After his death, his followers (called Remonstrants) formalized their theology in five articles of protest against Reformed orthodoxy.</p>

                <p>The controversy threatened to split the Dutch Reformed Church and even had political implications for the young Dutch Republic. To settle the dispute, Prince Maurice of Nassau called for an international synod to convene in the city of Dordrecht (Dort) in November 1618.</p>

                <p>The <strong>Synod of Dort</strong> was one of the most significant ecclesiastical assemblies in church history. It included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>84 Dutch delegates</strong> - Ministers, elders, and theological professors</li>
                    <li><strong>26 international delegates</strong> - From England, Scotland, Germany, and Switzerland</li>
                    <li><strong>154 sessions</strong> - Meeting from November 1618 to May 1619</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Synod examined the Five Articles of Remonstrance point by point, comparing them with Scripture and Reformed confessional standards. After seven months of deliberation, the assembly unanimously condemned Arminianism and affirmed what became known as the Five Points of Calvinism in the Canons of Dort.</p>

                <h3>Structure of the Canons of Dort</h3>
                <p>Unlike other confessions, the Canons of Dort are structured around <strong>five main heads of doctrine</strong>, each responding to a specific Arminian error:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First Head of Doctrine</strong> - Divine Election and Reprobation (18 articles)</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Head of Doctrine</strong> - The Death of Christ and Human Redemption (9 articles)</li>
                    <li><strong>Third and Fourth Heads of Doctrine</strong> - Human Corruption and Conversion to God (17 articles combined)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fifth Head of Doctrine</strong> - The Perseverance of the Saints (15 articles)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each head includes both positive statements of Reformed doctrine and explicit rejections of corresponding Arminian errors.</p>

                <h3>The Five Points of Calvinism: TULIP Explained</h3>
                <p>The acronym <strong>TULIP</strong> is a popular way to remember the five doctrines affirmed by the Canons of Dort. While the acronym itself came later, it accurately summarizes the canons' teaching:</p>

                <div class="tulip-section">
                    <h4>T - Total Depravity</h4>
                    <p><strong>Teaching:</strong> All people are born in sin and are completely unable to save themselves or even choose God apart from His grace.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> "The mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot" (Romans 8:7).</p>
                    <p><strong>Dort's Response:</strong> The canons teach that original sin has corrupted all of human nature. People cannot exercise saving faith without the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit (Third/Fourth Head, Article 3).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tulip-section">
                    <h4>U - Unconditional Election</h4>
                    <p><strong>Teaching:</strong> God chose those He would save before the foundation of the world, not based on anything foreseen in them, but solely according to His sovereign good pleasure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> "He chose us in him before the foundation of the world...having predestined us for adoption" (Ephesians 1:4-5).</p>
                    <p><strong>Dort's Response:</strong> Election is "the unchangeable purpose of God, whereby, before the foundation of the world, he has out of mere grace...chosen from the whole human race...a certain number of persons to redemption in Christ" (First Head, Article 7).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tulip-section">
                    <h4>L - Limited Atonement (Particular Redemption)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Teaching:</strong> Christ's death actually accomplished salvation for the elect. He died specifically to save His people, not merely to make salvation possible for all.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> "I lay down my life for the sheep" (John 10:15). Christ gave himself "to redeem us from all lawlessness" (Titus 2:14).</p>
                    <p><strong>Dort's Response:</strong> It was God's will "that Christ...should effectually redeem...all those, and those only, who were from eternity chosen to salvation" (Second Head, Article 8).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tulip-section">
                    <h4>I - Irresistible Grace (Effectual Calling)</h4>
                    <p><strong>Teaching:</strong> When God calls His elect to salvation through the gospel, His grace is so powerful that it overcomes all resistance and brings them to faith.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> "All that the Father gives me will come to me" (John 6:37). "Those whom he predestined he also called" (Romans 8:30).</p>
                    <p><strong>Dort's Response:</strong> God "powerfully illuminates their minds...and powerfully renews their wills" so that "they, who were dead, are made alive" (Third/Fourth Head, Articles 11-12).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tulip-section">
                    <h4>P - Perseverance of the Saints</h4>
                    <p><strong>Teaching:</strong> Those whom God has called and justified will certainly persevere in faith and can never lose their salvation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> "He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion" (Philippians 1:6). "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish" (John 10:28).</p>
                    <p><strong>Dort's Response:</strong> Because God's purpose "cannot be changed," believers "can neither totally nor finally fall away from faith and grace, but shall certainly persevere therein to the end, and be eternally saved" (Fifth Head, Article 8).</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Why Study the Canons of Dort?</h3>
                <p>The Canons of Dort remain vitally relevant for several reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Biblical Precision</strong> - They carefully articulate what Scripture teaches about God's sovereignty in salvation</li>
                    <li><strong>Pastoral Comfort</strong> - They assure believers that their salvation depends on God's unchangeable purpose, not their own wavering faith</li>
                    <li><strong>Historical Significance</strong> - They represent centuries of Reformed theological reflection and international consensus</li>
                    <li><strong>Contemporary Relevance</strong> - The Arminian-Calvinist debate continues today, making the canons essential for understanding competing theological systems</li>
                    <li><strong>Worship Foundation</strong> - Understanding God's sovereign grace leads to deeper worship and humility before His majesty</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Canons of Dort are not merely an academic exercise in systematic theology. They are a pastoral document designed to give Christians confidence in the God who saves completely, preserves perfectly, and will bring all His elect to glory.</p>

                    <p>The Canons of Dort are a Reformed confessional document adopted at the Synod of Dort (1618-1619). They articulate five doctrines concerning God's sovereignty in salvation, commonly known as the Five Points of Calvinism or TULIP.</p>
